				MAGIC took a field trip with some of the girls that we mentor from the local high schools. The field trip took place at a local company in Indiana called Luther Consulting. The company performs web-based data collection and reporting for the public health industry through the creation of EvalutaionWeb®, and has expanded to be able to collect and report almost any type of data. The girls who went on the trip, got to tour the insides of the company, getting to see what the places open work environment is like, with “fun” designed breakrooms with kitchens, and whiteboard walls for different parts of the building.
			<br><br>
			They also got to speak with different employees about their jobs, and ask questions about what they did day to day. They got to hear about the different challenges and benefits that came with being a software engineer, as well as observe what they were doing. They also listened about the projects that they were currently working on.

				After the tour, the girls were able to do a workshop, in which they broke off into groups and collaborated with one another on different ideas and solutions for the activities that were presented to them. The learned more about what the company did, and how important collaboration and teamwork was in order for the their environment to work efficiently.
