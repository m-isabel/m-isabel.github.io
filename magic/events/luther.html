			BoilerCode is mini hackathon designed for middle and high schools of both
			genders to come and explore the field of computer science in an interactive
			day of learning. The kids who came utilized the tool MIT App Inventor to
			create an app in 3 hours that they would present at the end of the hackathon.
			Anyone who is not familiar with the App Inventor will find it similar to a
			beginners programming language called Scratch, both using the concepts of drag
			and drop programming. There were roughly 25 kids who came to the hackathon,
			each kid was partnered with another participant and a mentor who would help
			them learn to use the App Inventor to create their very own app. Each mentor
			was required to go through a training session that would familiarize them
			with the programming language and brief them on what would be occurring
			during the hackathon. There was multiple meetings for the committee that was
			hosting the event, where the planning for the details of the hackathon
			happened. Where sub committees were made in order to organize who would be
			in charge of the food, forms, emails, activities, volunteers, schedules,
			mentors, training days and more.
			<br>
			The day of the hackathon, each kid received an official BoilerCode t-shirt as
			they checked in, as well as “SWAG” bag at the end of the day for completing
			their project. As the day began, they were gathered in a presentation room to
			hear what they would be doing for the day, and were introduced to each other.
			After each mentee found their mentor and when went to their directed lab to
			work in, where the mentor spend an hour and half teaching their kids how to
			use the app, and going over tutorials with them. Because their were so many
			mentors, it was easy to give as much attention needed to the kids, helping
			them understanding concepts like if statements, while loops, and how to connect
			things.

			After the Introduction to Programming session, lunch broke out,
			where the kids were able to relax and talk with their mentors about
			opportunities in the field of Computer Science. Kids asked about what the
			mentors had programmed, what a real hackathon was like, and a lot of them
			were excited about future steps to learn more about how to program.

			After lunch, the kids got to begin working on their own mini coding project,
			where they brainstormed with their mentors for ideas. Then went on to explore
			how they were going to implement their ideas. Projects, like mini games, spin
			off versions of Flappy Bird, Cat Fact apps, popped up. Fortune cookie apps,
			and Phone Calling apps were all presented at the end. Kids learned how to work
			with sprites, and sensors in order while trying to create their app, along
			with learning the concepts of programming, using blocks to build bodies of
			code. Parents were invited in at the end of the day, to sit and hear all the
			presentations. Kids came up one by one with their apps downloaded to either
			a phone or kindle as they explained what their projects did. One kid explained
			their game that had an automated tank, that would try to hunt down another
			tank, in which you had to use the arrow buttons that were given to you, in
			order to maneuver out of the way, and shoot down the other tank. Another
			mentee came up and presented their app, where depending on your mood you
			would press on own of the colored blocks, and it which screen to a
			background with the mood on it and begin playing a sound clip that would
			fit your mood. The kids were very excited and proud of what they did at the
			end, and most if not all of them asked if the same event would be happening
			again next year.
